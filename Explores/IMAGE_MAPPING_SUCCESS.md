## Image Matching Strategy Used

The generator successfully matched images using the following strategy:

1. **Exact filename match** - Matches complete filename
2. **Without extension match** - Matches name without .jpeg/.jpg/.png
3. **ID part match** - Matches the ID portion before first underscore (e.g., `67e6792c696d66a952dfdc92`)
4. **Fuzzy/partial match** - Case-insensitive substring matching

## Files Generated

âœ… **Test Collection** (5 entries)
- Path: `collection/Strapi_Explores_Test_5_Collection.postman_collection.json`
- Size: 176 lines
- Purpose: Test before full upload

âœ… **Complete Collection** (1,334 entries)
- Path: `collection/Strapi_Explores_Complete_Collection.postman_collection.json`
- Size: 41,375 lines
- Purpose: Full migration

âœ… **Environment File**
- Path: `collection/Strapi_Explores_Environment.postman_environment.json`
- Purpose: API token and base URL configuration

## Missing Images (0.6%)

Only **8 main images** could not be mapped:

These entries will be created without main images and can be manually attached later in Strapi admin panel if needed.

## Missing Author Pictures (16.4%)

**219 author pictures** could not be mapped:

This is likely because:
- Some authors don't have profile pictures uploaded
- Filenames don't match the expected pattern
- These can be added manually later if needed

## Missing City Blogs (0.8%)

**11 city blogs** could not be mapped:

Example:
- Slug: `best-travel-tips-for-exploring-kalundborg-flights-food-and-fun`

These entries will be created without city blog relationships and can be linked manually.
