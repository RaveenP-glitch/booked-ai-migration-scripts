## üìù Step-by-Step Migration

### Step 1: Prepare Images ‚úÖ

Images are already compressed and ready in `compressed-images/` folder.

**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete (1335 images ready)

### Step 2: Upload Images to Strapi ‚úÖ

~~Run the bulk upload script:~~

```bash
node upload_images_to_strapi.js YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

**Expected time**: ~15-20 minutes for 1335 images

**What it does**:
- Uploads each image to Strapi
- Skips images that already exist
- Shows progress every 50 images
- Reports failures at the end

**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - All images uploaded to Strapi

### Step 3: Fetch Media IDs ‚úÖ

~~After upload, fetch the media IDs:~~

```bash
node fetch-strapi-media.js YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

**What it does**:
- Fetches all media from Strapi API
- Creates `media-ids-and-names.json` mapping
- Verifies all local images are in Strapi
- Reports success rate

**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Using Graphql-asset-manager/media-ids-and-names.json

### Step 4: Generate Collections ‚úÖ

Generate Postman collections with proper media mapping:

```bash
node generate_postman_collection.js
```

**What it does**:
- Loads CSV data (1334 entries)
- Maps images using media-ids-and-names.json
- Maps City Blogs using all-city-blogs.json
- Generates test collection (5 entries)
- Generates complete collection (1334 entries)
- Shows mapping statistics

**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Collections generated with 99.4% image mapping success!

### Step 5: Test with 5 Entries ‚è≥

1. Import `Strapi_Explores_Test_5_Collection.postman_collection.json` to Postman
2. Import `Strapi_Explores_Environment.postman_environment.json`
3. Set your API token in the environment
4. Run the collection
5. Verify entries in Strapi admin panel

**Status**: ‚è≥ Pending

### Step 6: Upload All Entries ‚è≥

Once testing is successful:

1. Import `Strapi_Explores_Complete_Collection.postman_collection.json`
2. Run the collection
3. Monitor progress
4. Verify in Strapi admin panel

**Status**: ‚è≥ Pending

| Collection size | ~41,000 lines (complete) |

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue: Images not showing in entries

**Solution**: 
1. Verify images were uploaded (check Step 2)
2. Verify media mapping exists (check Step 3)
3. Regenerate collections (run Step 4 again)

### Issue: ValidationError on upload

**Solution**:
- Check API token permissions
- Verify Title is unique
- Review Strapi logs for detailed error

### Issue: Upload script fails

**Solution**:
- Check network connection
- Verify API token has upload permission
- Reduce rate limit (increase delay in script)
- Check Strapi disk space
