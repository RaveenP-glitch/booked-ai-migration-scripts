However, since it is so old and not updated there are things that the owners and management could and SHOULD do in order to want their patrons to return and/or refer the hotel on to others. These are a few of my experiences that could of been avoided. * Breakfast was advertised but when I checked in, was told No breakfast offered. *Cold coffee, (morning 1)offered in the lobby along with hot water for tea. One Generic container of powder creamer and a handful of sugar packets. Informed the person on duty of the Cold coffee. *Cold coffee, (morning 2) informed attendant at front desk. * Cold coffee, (morning 3) Used the microwave in the lobby to heat it up. * Asked the front desk if I could get another bottle of water. I was told No, you only get the two in your room. (Which you have to purchase.) * NO vending machines * No ice machines * Very limited TV channels * Plumbing/Hot water issues Hotel, rooms, hallways and lobby are all very outdated. Very understandable considering the age of the building. But you could offer so much more with just the small stuff to help your patrons look past the old and worn stuff. Shame on you!
