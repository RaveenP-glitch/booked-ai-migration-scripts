## üö® Important Notes

### File Naming
‚ö†Ô∏è **Do NOT rename these files before uploading!**
- The shortened names are critical for matching
- The generation script expects these exact names
- Renaming will break the image ID lookup

### Upload All at Once
‚úÖ **Upload all 139 images in a single batch**
- This is faster than uploading individually
- Ensures all images are available at once
- Prevents partial data issues

### Verify Upload
After upload to Strapi:
1. Check that all 139 images appear in Media Library
2. Verify file sizes match (83 MB total)
3. Ensure no upload errors occurred
