One of the world's most remote landforms of continental origin, it is the largest of the four islands that make up the Socotra archipelago. It's so remote, in fact, that a third of its vegetation is unique to its territory and cannot be found anywhere else on Earth. Because of the peculiar-looking, umbrella-shaped trees that adorn the terrain, it is known as Dragon's Blood Island. There are a few villages scattered around, and Hadiboh, the capital, has the sense of a large town rather than a big city."

A trip to the New Orleans Historic Voodoo Museum will teach you everything you need to know about voodoo and black magic. This is a synthesis of European and African influences that came together in New Orleans' multicultural melting pot. To really take it to the next level, there's even a Museum of Death and a cemetery tour."

In addition to its remarkable waterfalls, medieval castles, untamed landscapes, and imposing rock formations, the Isle of Skye is renowned for its spectacular weather patterns. The names of several sites, like Fairy Glen, Fairy Pools, and Fairy Bridge—all of which are believed to be gathering spots for pixies—come from the belief that fairies and pixies wander the area. The renowned Kilt Rock and Mealt Falls are located along the coast, and it is believed that the kilt of a big Scottish man formed them."
