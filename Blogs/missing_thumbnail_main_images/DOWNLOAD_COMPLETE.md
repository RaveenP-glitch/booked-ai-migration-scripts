## Image Name Shortening Applied

All downloaded images have been renamed using the **image name shortening strategy**:

### Strategy Applied:
1. **Hash**: First 8 characters of the 24-character hash
2. **Name**: First 20 characters of the descriptive name
3. **Extension**: Preserved original extension

### Examples:

| Original Filename | Shortened Filename |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| `665fdba89673c9fd0d6f69ac_AI Travel Agent.jpg` | `665fdba8_AI Travel Agent.jpg` |
| `667e526a7dc31ffcdb6dffcf_Best Vacation Sports For Couples TN.jpg` | `667e526a_Best Vacation Sports.jpg` |
| `6685bc74a7793f04eabbb918_lighthouse-on-near-body-of-water-between-rock-formation.jpg` | `6685bc74_lighthouse-on-near-b.jpg` |

## Important Notes

### Image Name Matching
‚úÖ The shortened filenames will match the format in your updated `all-images.json` after upload  
‚úÖ The generation script will automatically find these images by their 8-character hash prefix  
‚úÖ No manual ID mapping required once images are in Strapi

### File Quality
‚úÖ All images downloaded at full resolution  
‚úÖ Original formats preserved (JPG, PNG, WEBP)  
‚úÖ No compression applied

### Unique Images
‚úÖ Duplicate URLs were automatically detected and downloaded only once  
‚úÖ 202 unique images even though there are more blog entries (some blogs share images)

---

## Troubleshooting

### If any images fail to show after upload:
1. Check that filenames match exactly (case-sensitive)
2. Verify all 202 images were uploaded successfully in Strapi
3. Ensure the new `all-images.json` export includes all uploaded images
4. Re-run the generation script

### If generation still shows null IDs:
1. Verify the 8-character hash prefix matches between:
   - Downloaded filename: `665fdba8_...`
   - Strapi filename: `665fdba8...`
2. Check that `all-images.json` was updated after upload
3. Clear any caches and try again
